## Summary

I'm a Cybersecurity Professional focusing primarily on application/product security engineering and penetration testing. I have been in hacking and security since 2009, and I have experience working for a company and the government professionally for the past six years.

Currently, I'm building application security (AppSec) programs with the DevSecOps initiative at Batam Indonesia Free Zone Authority (BIFZA) as part of the secure software development processes and aiding with vulnerability management across all of our internal and external surfaces, including active monitoring of digital assets. In my free time, I have helped identify and exploit security vulnerabilities in various global companies and organizations, such as Cisco, Salesforce, Gojek, PUPG, ABB, MTN Group, government sites, and more.
